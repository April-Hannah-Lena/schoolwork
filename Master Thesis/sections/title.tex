\section*{Abstract}

Koopman operator theory converts traditional analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems into 
analysis of composition operators, allowing one to use mature tools from linear functional 
analysis but requires working in infinite dimensional space. Common Petrov-Galerkin 
methods for Koopman operator analysis suffer from \emph{spectral pollution} - elements 
in the approximated spectrum which are caused solely by discretization and do not 
approximate elements in the true spectrum of the Koopman operator. Resolvent-based 
algorithms to identify spectral pollution are studied, resulting in new connections and 
insights about existing methods, as well as a new method based on previous work. 
Moreover, the notion of "true" Koopman spectrum is critically investigated.
